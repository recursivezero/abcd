## 🐦

One hot summer afternoon, a **Crow** was flying over a village in search of water. The sun was blazing, and the ground was dry. The poor crow was very thirsty and growing tired.

Finally, he spotted a **clay pot** outside a hut. He flew down eagerly and looked inside. There was a little water at the bottom — but the **neck of the pot was too narrow**, and his beak couldn’t reach it.

The Crow didn’t give up. He looked around and saw small **pebbles** nearby. One by one, he dropped them into the pot. Slowly, the water rose higher and higher. At last, the water reached the top!

The Crow happily drank and flew away, cool and refreshed, proud of his clever idea.
