## 🌈 Holi

In the colorful town of **Mathura**, everyone was preparing for **Holi**, the festival of colors. Streets were full of music, sweets, and laughter. Children ran with gulal in their hands, ready to splash joy on everyone.

Among them were two best friends — **Radha** and **Meera**. Every year, they played Holi together. But this year, something was different. A small fight had started two days ago over a broken toy. Now, both girls were angry and not talking.

On the day of Holi, Radha stood with a plate full of colors, looking around sadly. Meera was on the other side, holding her pichkari but not smiling.

Their friends tried to cheer them up, but nothing worked. Then came **Dadi Ma**, the wise old lady of the neighborhood. She smiled and said, “Do you know what makes Holi special? It’s not just the colors on our face, but the colors in our hearts.”

Radha and Meera looked at each other. Slowly, Radha picked up pink color and walked toward Meera. “Happy Holi,” she said softly.

Meera’s eyes sparkled. She took blue color and gently put it on Radha’s cheek. “Happy Holi,” she replied.

Soon, they were laughing and playing together again. Red, yellow, green, and orange flew through the air. The Holi rainbow had returned — not just in the sky, but in their hearts.
