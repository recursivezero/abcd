## 🦁

Deep in the jungle, a mighty **Lion** lay resting under a tree. While he slept, a tiny **Mouse** ran across his paw, chasing a leaf. The Lion woke up with a loud roar and caught the Mouse under his claws.

“Who dares to disturb the king of the jungle?” he growled.

“Please forgive me, O King!” squeaked the Mouse. “Let me go, and someday I might help you in return.”

The Lion laughed. “A little thing like you helping me? That’s amusing!” But he gently let the Mouse go and went back to sleep.

A few days later, hunters set a **trap** in the forest. The Lion was caught in a net and roared in anger. Hearing his cries, the Mouse rushed over, **nibbled the ropes**, and freed the Lion.

“You helped me after all!” the Lion said gratefully. The two became friends, proving that courage and kindness come in all sizes.
