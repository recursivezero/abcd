## ðŸ“–

In a peaceful village lived a gentle kitten named **Momo**, whose white fur and joyful spirit brought light to everyone around her. One bright morning, she chased a red butterfly beyond her garden and soon realized she was lost.
Surrounded by unfamiliar sights and sounds, Momo cried for help, her tiny voice filled with fear.

Just then, **Bruno**, a kind and noble dog, heard her cries. Guided by compassion, he offered to help Momo find her way home. Together, they wandered through the village, asking for directions from birds, cows, and even the postman.
Their journey reflected the strength found in kindness, courage, and the willingness to help others.

Eventually, a young girl recognized Momo and ran to her with joy. Momo purred with relief, and the girl thanked Bruno for his noble deed. From that day forward, Momo stayed close to her home, remembering the lesson of trust, safety, and
the goodness that helped her find her way back.
