## 🏹

Long ago, in a forest village, lived a young and brave boy named **Ekalavya**. He belonged to a tribal family, but his heart burned with one dream — to become the **greatest archer** in the world.

He went to **Guru Dronacharya**, the royal teacher of the princes, and begged to be his student. But Drona sadly refused, saying he could only teach royals like **Arjuna**. Ekalavya was hurt, but he didn’t give up.

He made a **statue of Dronacharya** from clay and began practicing before it every day, treating it like his real guru. Through dedication and hard work, Ekalavya soon became a skilled archer — sharp, fast, and focused.

One day, Dronacharya and the princes saw a dog whose mouth had been sealed with arrows — without hurting it! Surprised, they found Ekalavya and asked who his teacher was. Ekalavya bowed and pointed to the clay statue.

Drona was amazed but worried that Ekalavya might become better than Arjuna. So, he asked for **guru dakshina** — the fee from a student to his teacher.

“I wish to take your **right thumb**,” he said. Without question, Ekalavya bowed, smiled, and **cut off his thumb**, offering it with love and respect.

He could no longer shoot like before, but Ekalavya’s name lives on as a symbol of true **devotion and humility**.
