## ðŸ¦š The Krishna

In the beautiful town of **Gokul**, a boy named **Krishna** grew up with mischief in his smile and music in his heart. Though born in Mathura, he was raised by **Yashoda Maa** and **Nanda Baba** to protect him from the cruel king **Kansa**.
Krishna played with his friends, stole butter from pots, and danced joyfully with the gopis. His flute could calm storms and make peacocks dance. 
He defeated evil beings like **Putana**, **Trinavarta**, and even danced on the head of the poisonous serpent **Kaliya**. 
When angry rains threatened his village, Krishna lifted **Govardhan Hill** with just one finger, giving shelter to all. The people of Gokul saw not just a naughty boy, but someone truly divine.

Years passed, and Krishna journeyed back to **Mathura** where he defeated Kansa and freed his parents. Later, he built **Dwarka**, guided kings with wisdom, and became the charioteer for **Arjuna** during the great **Mahabharata** war. 
On the battlefield of **Kurukshetra**, Krishna spoke the sacred words of the **Bhagavad Gita**, teaching about truth, duty, and the soul. Though he never held a weapon in the war, his wisdom helped restore balance to the world. 
When his time came, Krishna left the world quietly, under a tree, like the setting sun after a golden day. But his flute still echoes in stories, songs, and hearts â€” reminding us to live with love, courage, and kindness.
