## 🐒

Long ago, near the banks of the **Ganga river**, there lived a cheerful **Monkey** in a big fruit tree. He spent his days eating sweet **jamuns** and swinging joyfully among the branches.

One day, a **Crocodile** swam by and stopped to rest. The Monkey offered him some fruits. The Crocodile loved the jamuns and came back every day. Slowly, they became good friends.

One evening, the Crocodile told his wife about the kind Monkey. But she became jealous. “If the fruits are so sweet, imagine how sweet the Monkey’s **heart** must be! Bring it to me,” she demanded.

The Crocodile was troubled but agreed. The next day, he invited the Monkey for a ride across the river. Halfway through, he confessed his wife’s wish.

The Monkey stayed calm and said, “Oh, you should have told me earlier! I left my heart on the tree. Let’s go back and get it.”

The silly Crocodile turned around. As soon as they reached the shore, the Monkey jumped back to his tree. “Friendship is built on trust, not tricks!” he said, safe and wise.
