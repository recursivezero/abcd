One cold winter morning, **Emperor Akbar** and **Birbal** were walking in the royal garden. The sun was shining, but the air was chilly. Akbar wrapped his cloak tighter and said, “No one could stand outside all night in this cold!”

Birbal smiled and replied, “Some people can, Your Majesty — especially if they’re promised a reward.” Akbar laughed. “If anyone does that, I’ll give them **100 gold coins**!”

That evening, a poor man stood in the freezing garden pond, shivering all night with only his thoughts to keep him warm. The next day, he went to the court for his reward. But a minister said,
“You saw a **lamp burning** far away — that’s how you survived. No reward for you!”

The man left in tears. Birbal was upset. That night, he didn’t come to the palace. When Akbar sent a messenger, Birbal replied, “I’m cooking dinner under the sun — it should be ready soon!”

Akbar rushed over and saw a pot hanging high from a tree branch, with a fire lit on the ground far below. “How can your food cook like this?” he laughed.

Birbal bowed and said, “Just like that man stayed warm from a lamp far away.” Akbar understood, smiled, and immediately gave the man his **full reward**.
