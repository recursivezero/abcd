## 🍇

One hot afternoon, a hungry **Fox** was walking through a garden when he spotted a bunch of juicy **purple grapes** hanging from a vine. His mouth watered. “Ah, those grapes look perfect!” he said.

He jumped once — too low. He tried again — still no luck. The grapes were just too high. The Fox took a few steps back and leapt again, higher this time — but missed by inches. He panted and stared up.

After many tries, the tired Fox finally gave up. As he walked away, he muttered, “Those grapes are probably **sour** anyway.”

The Fox left the garden, pretending he didn’t want them in the first place, but deep down, he was still very hungry — and a little embarrassed too.

## 🌼 Moral of the Story

**It’s easy to dislike what we cannot have. Accepting failure gracefully is better than pretending it didn’t matter.**
