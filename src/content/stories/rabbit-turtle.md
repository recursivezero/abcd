## 🐢 The Race of Rabbit and Turtle

In a quiet forest, animals gathered around the big tree for a fun announcement. The **Rabbit**, proud of his speed, shouted, “I challenge anyone to a race! No one can beat me!” 
The forest fell silent — until the **Turtle** slowly raised his head and said, “I accept.”

All the animals laughed. “He’s too slow!” whispered the squirrel. But the Turtle smiled. “Let’s see what happens,” he said gently.

The next morning, the race began. “On your marks… go!” shouted the parrot. The Rabbit dashed off like lightning, leaving the Turtle far behind. But soon, the Rabbit grew tired and thought, *“I’m so far ahead, I’ll just nap under this tree.”*

Meanwhile, the Turtle kept going — slow, steady, step by step. The Rabbit snored peacefully as the Turtle passed him quietly and neared the finish line. When the Rabbit woke up, he jumped up and ran — but it was too late.

The forest animals cheered as the Turtle crossed the line. “How did he win?” cried the Rabbit. The Turtle looked back and said, “You may be fast, my friend, but I never stopped moving forward.”
