## ðŸ“– The Ramayan 

Long ago in the kingdom of **Ayodhya**, there lived a noble king named **Dasharatha**. He had four sonsâ€”**Rama**, **Lakshmana**,
**Bharata**, and **Shatrughna**. Rama, the eldest, was wise, brave, and loved by all. He married the beautiful and kind princess
**Sita**.

King Dasharatha wanted Rama to be the next king. But Queen **Kaikeyi** asked that her son **Bharata** be crowned, and that Rama
be sent to the forest for **14 years**. The king was heartbroken, but Rama accepted the exile calmly. Sita and Lakshmana chose
to go with him.

In the forest, the demon king **Ravana** tricked Sita and kidnapped her. Rama and Lakshmana searched everywhere. They made friends
with the monkey king **Sugriva** and the mighty **Hanuman**. Hanuman flew across the ocean and found Sita in **Lanka**.

Rama, with the help of monkeys and bears, built a bridge to Lanka. A fierce battle took place. Rama defeated Ravana and rescued
Sita. Everyone was happy and full of joy.

After 14 years, Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana returned to Ayodhya. The people welcomed them with lights and celebration. This day
is now celebrated as **Diwali**, the festival of lights.

Rama became king and ruled with fairness and kindness. His rule, called **Ram Rajya**, was a time of peace, happiness, and
justice.
