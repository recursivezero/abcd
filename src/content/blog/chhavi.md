## 🌟 My Internship Journey: What I’ve Learned So Far

From student to developer, my recent internship experience has been nothing short of transformative.
I'm **Chhavi Sharma**, an enthusiastic web developer currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science from **The ICFAI University, Jaipur**.
Over the past two months, I had the incredible opportunity to intern as a **Software Developer Trainee** at **RecursiveZero Pvt. Ltd**.

This journey was far more than just writing code; it was a deep dive into modern frontend technologies, understanding the nuances of a corporate work environment, and embracing professional development practices.
Under the exceptional guidance of **Mr. Keshav Mohta**, I truly began to grasp the essence of frontend engineering.
This blog is a reflection of what I’ve worked on, the skills I’ve gained, and the lessons I’ll carry forward.

## 🚧 Projects I Worked On

I contributed to the following key pages and features for the **abcdkbd** project:

### 🏠 [Home Page](/)

I designed and structured the home page to ensure a smooth user experience with a responsive layout and clean navigation.

### 🪔 [Varnmala Page](/varnmala/)

I developed a rich, multi-section learning space for learners. The **Varnmala** section was broken down into six interactive subpages:

- [**Hindi**](/varnmala/hindi) – Displayed _स्वर_ and _व्यंजन_.
- [**English**](/varnmala/english/) – Offered a comparative look at English alphabet letters.
- [**Barahkhadi**](/varnmala/barahkhadi/) – Showcased combinations of consonants and matras visually.
- [**Listen**](/varnmala/listen/) – Implemented **Text-to-Speech** functionality for hearing pronunciation.
- [**Write**](/varnmala/write/) – Guided users on how to write letters through animated stroke visuals.
- [**Play**](/varnmala/play/) – Created interactive games/activities to reinforce what users learned.

This section focused on clean layouts, intuitive navigation, and accessibility for early learners.

### 🔤 [Alphabets Page](/alphabets)

I developed a separate alphabets section with **animated SVG letter drawings** and **reset/play controls** — making learning fun and interactive.

### 🔢 [Numbers Page](/math)

I created an interactive number page featuring content for English, Hindi, Morse code, and Roman numerals.

### 📚 [Glossary Page](/glossary)

I structured glossary terms across themes like **Months**, **Days**, and **Geometrical Shapes**, using **dynamic JSON rendering** and category-based filtering.

### 🔮 [Nakshatra Page](/nakshtra)

I designed and developed a **visual representation of Nakshatra**, using reusable components and clean layouts for better scalability.

## ⚙️ Tech I Explored

This internship introduced me to powerful tools and concepts that significantly improved my skills:

### 🚀 Astro Framework

I gained a solid understanding of Astro’s **component-based static site generation**.
I implemented **layouts, partial hydration, and slot usage**, building fast and **SEO-optimized** content-driven pages.

### 🗺️ Dynamic Routing

I used **file-based routing** in Astro for dynamic glossary and category pages, passing route parameters to generate content on-the-fly.

### 🗣️ [Web Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API)

I integrated **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** features using the Web Speech API, enabling **audio feedback** for alphabets — improving accessibility and user engagement.

### 🎨 Modern CSS Features

While working on UI/UX, I explored several modern CSS features, including:

- **CSS Grid & Subgrid** – For complex, responsive layout designs.
- [**Container Queries**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_container_queries) – Made components respond to container size.
- **CSS Variables (`--var`)** – Maintained design consistency and simplified theming.
- **Clamp Function (`clamp()`)** – Created fluid responsive typography and spacing.
- **Backdrop Filter** – Applied glassmorphism-style blur effects.
- **Scroll Snap** – Added smoother section-based scrolling on mobile.
- **Animations** using `@keyframes` & `transition` – For SVG letter drawings, button hovers, and more.
- [**Popover API**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Popover_API) – Learned to use the new native Popover API for creating lightweight contextual overlays without external libraries.

### 💻 Git & GitHub

I gained hands-on experience working with **branches**, **pull requests**, and **merge conflict resolution**.
I reviewed code, maintained readable commit messages, and collaborated using GitHub Issues, learning to document progress and communicate through version control.

### 💻 Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

I used **VS Code** as my primary development environment throughout the internship.
I utilized the **Project Manager** extension to quickly switch between different project folders and codebases.
I created and managed **VS Code Workspaces** to organize multiple related folders (e.g., components, i18n files, pages) for better context and navigation.
I also leveraged helpful extensions like **Prettier**, **ESLint**, and **Astro Language Tools** to write clean and consistent code.

## 💡 What I Learned Beyond Code

- **Communication** – I learned to share updates clearly, discuss blockers effectively, and contribute meaningfully to team decisions.
- **Problem-solving** – I sharpened my debugging skills by fixing layout bugs and animation sync issues, and gained experience working with modern Browser APIs.
- **Responsibility** – I delivered features independently and tracked my progress efficiently using GitHub project tools.

## 🎯 Final Thoughts

This internship has been a **transformative learning experience**.
From Astro and GitHub workflows to Speech APIs and modern CSS — I’ve picked up tools and practices that make me a better developer and collaborator.

I now feel confident in:

- Building **accessible**, **responsive** UIs from scratch.
- Creating **animated and interactive** web components.
- Using **modern CSS** for elegant and maintainable design.
- Collaborating on real-world projects using **GitHub**.
